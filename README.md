## A bit more about me

Over the years, I have worked as an employee in both Italy and abroad for private companies and institutional bodies before starting my own business. I currently live in Florence, a city that continues to inspire me daily, and I dedicate part of my time to volunteer projects that combine my passion for technology with the one for nature.
