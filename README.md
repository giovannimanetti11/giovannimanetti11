## A bit more about me

Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked in Italy and abroad for both private companies and institutional bodies. I currently live in Florence, a city that continues to inspire me daily. I also dedicate part of my time to volunteer projects that combine my passion for technology with my love for nature.

## Currently working on
