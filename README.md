## A bit more about me

Over the years, I've worked in Italy and abroad for both private companies and institutional bodies. I currently live in Florence, a city that continues to inspire me daily. I also dedicate part of my time to volunteer projects that combine my passion for technology with my love for nature.

## Currently working at Tinexta Cyber SpA

Since December 2024, I work as a **Front End Developer** at Tinexta Cyber SpA, where I develop the frontend of cybersecurity applications. I mainly work with Vue.js for the frontend and I also work with Django templates and views.
